During these uncertain times, we urge you to take care of yourself, which also includes seeing your healthcare providers. Our clinicians and team members remain here to assist you with your dental needs and are available to answer any questions you might have. Additional measures to further protect our patients and team members: Pre-Screening: We will communicate with you before your appointment to ask some screening questions. We will ask those same questions upon arrival for your appointment in addition to recording your temperature. If you have a cough, temperature or other symptoms consistent with COVID-19, we will kindly reschedule your appointment. Direct-To-Room: Before your appointment, you have the option to stay in your car instead of the waiting room until we are ready to seat you in your personal operatory. Simply call us upon arrival and we will let you know when we are ready for you. Protect Yourself: We encourage you to utilize our hand sanitizer, wear a mask and continue social distancing for the near term. Mouth Rinse: We could ask you to pre-rinse with peroxide which has anti-fungal, anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties. Team Member Screening: We are also screening our team members twice daily to ensure the safety of patients and team members","how_to_help_this_business":null,"dine_in":null,"outdoor_dining":null,"outdoor_recreation":null,"outdoor_retail":null,"outdoor_services":null,"gift_cards":null,"delivery":null,"take_out":null,"order_online":null,"noconosh":null,"doordash":null,"grubhub":null,"postmates":null,"bottles":null,"cans":null,"crowlers":null,"growlers":null,"product_options":null,"availability":null,"meta_row_index":"178","meta_row_id":"f48e68ab0f183009a469b174a648c1ce28aa65f0",":@computed_region_j8ea_wntw":"498"}},
