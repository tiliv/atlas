# Atlas

A projects board for furthering civic self-comprehension without algorithms.

## Direction

Our work is in progress and in the open, currently [https://atlas.discoverywritten.com](https://atlas.discoverywritten.com). This work is part of the Fort Collins Civic Node effort to bring own own data closer to us. [FCCN "Antibody"](https://github.com/FCCN-ANTIBODY) leads this resource's design and implementation. You are invited to get in contact. Our [Contribute](https://github.com/tiliv/atlas/wiki/Contribute) and [Projects](https://github.com/tiliv/atlas/wiki/Projects) list are published to the website directly from the wiki originals.

Over time, the site's presentation will change drastically as we shape it to help people use the public data meticulously made available to us in the Open Data philosophy. The [Socrata](https://dev.socrata.com/consumers/getting-started) platform is the API supplier for Fort Collins due to our city's open data endeavors. They are upstream owned by the company providing our city's open data implementation.

To use the developer [API Keys](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/210138558-Generating-App-Tokens-and-API-Keys), however, we need to signed registered application tokens. The data platform accepts authentication only as a user's normal session, or an sign app token by the API key. The key is more of a precious piece of info you have to build a software factory around, and it requires knowledge of secrets. To do this, a backend is traditionally required.

We expect that as the [Anecdote](https://anecdote.discoverywritten.com) implementation evolves in tandem, we can deliver a solution that works for people on the ground, at the point of inquiry.

Our mission is to make possible new [pro-social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosocial_behavior) behaviors with our own data. As we structure data for need, we will obstruct multi-national and national usage of it. This is our data, and we arrange it for our communities. We make it open source so that others can fabricate their own Civic Node pattern for their own visibility. Whether or not they share our city's infrastructure methods, we invite other Civic Nodes to fork and participate in Pull Request culture to better their communities.

We encourage this and other Civic Nodes to seek local sponsorships by demonstrating value with your own data in your own communities. Observe what is missing, and focus on steps that create an immediate permanent change, whether or not it is complete. Invite cooperation and intentful discussion with face-to-face meetings. Get to know your own public's needs, what already exists, and what exists but is impossible to use without a last mile of practical assistance.
